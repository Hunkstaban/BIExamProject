# Business Intelligence Exam Project

## Initial Project Idea
### Movie Recommendation System
- Challenge: Helping users discover movies they are likely to enjoy based on their preferences, past watch history/ratings, and prompts. 

- Why?: Choice fatigue is often a factor when sitting down and being presented with the thousands of options available on streaming platforms. Personalized recommendations could both improve user satisfaction and could increase engagement and retention for streaming services.

- Solution: There are many sources readily available for data collection ex. IMDB, The Movie Database (TMDB) (Which I used in MP1), MovieLens dataset from GroupLens, The Movies Dataset from Kaggle, YouTube for trailers, etc. The system will be able to find movies based on users' preferences (filtering for genre, release year, rating, etc.), as well as the possibility to input movies they've watched in the past (where they can give their personal ratings) - but most importantly give the option to prompt for movie recommendations, ex.: "I want to watch a movie with a lots of car chases and a melodramatic lead actor". The system should also show which streaming platforms/services the movie is currently available for streaming/renting.

- Impact: An interactive recommendation system helps users quickly find movies they will enjoy, making their movie nights more efficient and enjoyable. Streaming platforms and movie websites benefit from increased user engagement and satisfaction, while users save time and discover new content tailored to their preferences. This idea could also help highlight lesser-known films.
